# Translating
You can speak your mother tongue? <br/>
You understand a certain language very well?<br/>
Then we need exactly **you for our translator team!**<br/>

After a long wait, the controlpanel has now been equipped with a translation system.<br/>

*Now we need people who help us translate!*

## How to help

The Translation list can be found here: <br/>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1day2die/dashboard/localization/resources/lang/en.json

Its simple to understand. The syntax goes like this <br/>
`'English-Phrase' : 'Your-Language-Translation',`

You first need a JSON-File named after your language's Language-Code <br/>
These can be taken from here <br/>
https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

Example:
`German = de`
`Dutch = nl`
`French = fr`

Copy the Contents of the above linked "en.json" and use it as a template for your language and just translate! <br/>
Its very easy and everyone can help us translate our panel!
